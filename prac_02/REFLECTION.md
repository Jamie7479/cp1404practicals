Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100% (i think)

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Monday mornings at home

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watching lectures before the seminars.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Do more of the activities in the lecture videos rather than just thinking through the process and deciding I can do it

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I keep using the wrong operators like "^" instead of "**" and "&&" instead of "and" and getting the wrong answers.. I also keep going to use camelCase :(

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I'm mostly finding them pretty easy. Some of the conventions are different to what i've done before but they're all pretty straightforward.
