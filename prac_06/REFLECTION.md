# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have been doing most of the lecture activities before going on and seeing the answers.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I haven't done any of the extension and practice exercises except for one week.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watching lectures before the seminar.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I tend to skim read the prac questions and sometimes miss important things.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I don't like that we can only use things we've learnt in class, while learning how to solve problems that we haven't
been specifically taught using online resources and forums is probably also an important skill to learn
